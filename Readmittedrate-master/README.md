# Readmitted-Rate
--------
**_Patients readmitted rate_**, which is a **supervised learning** classification problem. <br>
Using a combination of models **(KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Perceptron and Naïve Bayes algorithms）**<br>
to deal with the real-world datasets from UCI machine learning lab. <br>

Including:
---
EDA<br>
Data Cleaning<br>
Feature Seletion<br>
Models tuning<br>
Ensemble<br>
and get the best accuracy about the readmitted rate.
